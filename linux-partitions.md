# Formatting and partitioning

## MBR partitions

Traditionally formatted into 512 byte sectors, the sectors on a disk platter can be read without moving the head constitute a track.  Disks usually have more than one platter and the collection of tracks on the various platters that can be read without moving the head is called a cylinder.

Limitations on the sizes of cylinders, heads and sectors used with DOS operating systems resulted in BIOS translating geometry values so that larger hard drives could be supported but this eventually these were insufficient.

More recent developments in disk technology have led to logical block addressing (LBA) and a more modern format GUID partitio table GPT is being used instead of MBR.

Displaying MBR partitions with fdisk and parted

```sh
fdisk -l /dev/<partition>
# example
fdisk -l /dev/sdb
# examples output
# Disk /dev/sdb: 232.9 GiB, 250059350016 bytes, 488397168 sectors
# Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes

## GPT partitions

GPT supports up to 128 partitions by default. GPT disks do not have the concept of geometry as MBR disks do and were designed for use with a UEFI-based (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) system rather than BIOS.

To display information on GPT

```sh
# to get information on all disks
parted -l
# example output
# Model: ATA SAMSUNG MZMTD512 (scsi)
# Disk /dev/sda: 512GB
# Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
# Partition Table  : gpt

## Logical Volume Manager

With LVM as an abstract management of disk space a single filesystem can span multiple disks allowing easy manipulation of adding or removing space from filesystems

LVM manages disks using

* Physical Volumes (PVs) - either a whole drive or a partition
* Volume Groups (VGs) - a collection of 1 or more PVs - managed as one disk
* Logical Volumes (LVs) - analagous to a physical GPT or MBR partion as in a unit of space with a particular formatted filesystem (ext4, XFS ...) resides within a VG

**note** the default extent size is 4MB, be aware that all PVs in a VG must use the same extent size.


to format an exFAT partition use mkexfatfs / mkfs.exfat

```sh
mkfs.exfat /dev/sdc1
```
